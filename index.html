  <p>Sirius Black III (3 November,[1] 1959[16]–18 June, 1996[4]), also known as Padfoot or Snuffles (in his Animagus form) was an English pure-blood wizard, the older son of Orion and Walburga Black, the brother of Regulus Black, and godfather of
    Harry Potter. Although he was the heir of the House of Black, Sirius disagreed with his family's belief in blood purity and defied tradition when he was Sorted into Gryffindor House instead of Slytherin at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
    Wizardry, which he attended from 1971–1978. As the rest of his family had been in Slytherin, he was the odd one out.</p>
